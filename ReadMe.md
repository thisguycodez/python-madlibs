# Learning Python With Projects (Mad libs) 
> Syntax - Comments, Prints, Variables, Strings, Integers, String Concatenations, and Inputs.

> https://youtu.be/EWF32N_JYF0


## Tutorial
	    
___
#### test1.py file

>  1. comments - For python, used with a '#' symbol or 3 quotes nesting your comment:


* helps explain what the code is doing
  
* great for jogging your memory if you are editing old code
  
* helps keep code organized


> 2. prints - A function Used to send data to the console/terminal/screen:

* Keep track of data in any part of your code
* Great for debugging code
* Needed for terminal/CLI based programs

```python

print('ThisGuyCodez....*')
print(24)

```

### FROM NOW ON WE WILL USE PRINT TO DISPLAY OUR VALUES TO THE CONSOLE AND COMMENTS TO BE ORGANIZED


> 3. Strings, Integers , Floats , and Booleans - Data Types:


* 3a.) String{a sequence of characters within quotes} ...I will print this out below
```python
# printing 2 exmaples of a String
print('This is a String' , "I'm a string 2")
```
* 3b.) Integer{regular number} solid numbers only(NO COMMAS)...I will print this out below
```python
# printing 2 exmaples of an Integer
print(24 or 2400)
```
* 3c.) Float{decimals}...I will print this out below
```python
# printing 2 exmaples of a Float
print(5.1 or 33.33)
```
* 3d.) Boolean{One of the two values - True or False}...I will print this out below
```python
# printing exmaples of a Boolean
print(True or False)
```

> 4. Try writing the syntax yourself in the ~test1.py~ file:

```python
# Try it your self......
# Answer all the questions below, then move on to test2.py






# Try it your self......
# Answer all the questions below, then move on to test2.py



# 1.) print my youtube channel as a string...



'''
 2.) print the names of your favorite 
coding languages you know or the names 
of the ones you want to learn in a string...
''' 




# 3.) print a random number/integer...



# 4.) print a random decimal...



# 5.) print a bool...



# 6.) print a string, integer, decimal, and a bool...


```

___
#### test2.py file



> 1. Variables - A place to store values for your code to manipulate, for the computer to process, etc.:
'''python
you_tube = 'ThisGuyCodez'

print('here is a variable ---->',you_tube) 
'''			
> 2. String concatenation - more than one strings added together[Using the 'Format method']:
'''python
name = 'Guy'
you_tube = 'ThisGuyCodez'
lang = 'Python'

concat = f"{name} talks about	{lang} on his YT channel '{you_tube}'"
# -- OR --
concat = "{} talks about	{} on his YT channel '{}'".format(name,lang,you_tube)
			
print(concat)
'''

> 3. Inputs - Function used to get data from the user:
'''python
"""
Prompt the user by typing in 
the question the user should see
within the parentheses of the function as a string...
"""

input("Whats Your Name? ")	

"""		
-On the interacting side of things 
(in this case the console/terminal)
you would be able to actually type in your name..

>>> Whats Your Name? Guy

Even so, since we did not save it to a "Variable", there is
nothing we can do with it. Try what we went over so far yourself below
and remember to save your inputs into variables.

> # Mad Libs Project - Follow and apply each step.
  

```python 

# 1.)get the users name, favorite number, adv, and verb




# 2.) concat the inputs together in a sentence



# 3.) print your concat string

```
