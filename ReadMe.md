# Learning Python With Projects (Mad libs) 
> Syntax - Comments, Prints, Variables, Strings, Integers, String Concatenations, and Inputs.

## Tutorial
	    
___

>  1. comments - For python, used with a '#' symbol or 3 quotes nesting your comment:


* helps explain what the code is doing
  
* great for jogging your memory if you are editing old code
  
* helps keep code organized


> 2. prints - A function Used to send data to the console/terminal/screen:

* Keep track of data in any part of your code
* Great for debugging code
* Needed for terminal/CLI based programs

```python

print('ThisGuyCodez....*')
print(24)

```

* FROM NOW ON WE WILL USE PRINT TO DISPLAY OUR VALUES TO THE CONSOLE 


> 3. Strings, Integers , Floats , and Booleans - Data Types:


* 3a.) String{a sequence of characters within quotes}
```python
print('This is a String' , "I'm a string 2")
```
* 3b.) Integer{regular number} solid numbers only(NO COMMAS)
```python
print(24 or 2400)
```
* 3c.) Float{decimals}
```python
print(5.1 or 33.33)
```
* 3d.) Boolean{One of the two values - True or False}
```python
print(True or False)
```

> step 2: Try writing the syntax yourself below where you see the following lines of comments:

```python
# Try it your self......
# Answer all the questions below, then move on to test2.py






# Try it your self......
# Answer all the questions below, then move on to test2.py



# 1.) print my youtube channel as a string...



'''
 2.) print the names of your favorite 
coding languages you know or the names 
of the ones you want to learn in a string...
''' 




# 3.) print a random number/integer...



# 4.) print a random decimal...



# 5.) print a bool...



# 6.) print a string, integer, decimal, and a bool...


```

> # Mad Libs Project - Follow and apply each step.
  

```python 

# 1.)get the users name, favorite number, adv, and verb




# 2.) concat the inputs together in a sentence



# 3.) print your concat string
