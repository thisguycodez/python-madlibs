''' 3 Inputs{function used to get data from the user}
		-Prompt the user by typing in 
		the question the user should see
		within the parentheses of the function as a string...'''

input("Whats Your Name? ")

	

'''		-On the interacting side of things 
		(in this case the console/terminal)
		you would be able to actually type in your name..

		>>> Whats Your Name? Guy
